# Flutter Clean Architecture Task by AmirAbbas Jannatian

## About this repository

This is a code challenge task that written in flutter and dart. it uses clean archifecture approach and modular programming.

## Goal
A modular app with a single feature called "UserDetails." This page displays the user's name and email in a simple UI, and the user can enter their phone number to be saved in either remote or local data sources. Non-Iranian phone numbers should not be accepted.
I followed "Separation Of Concers" concept and implement each layer as separate as possible from other layers.

## Tools and Technologies

These tools and technologies helped me during the development proccess of this app:
- **git**: a popular version control system to manage app changes.
- **git flow**: branching model and command line tool for git, for better development experience.
- **Clean architecture**: an approach for writting cleaner, more testable, and maintanable code.
- **Test-Driven Development**: an approach for writting tests before actual code wrriten.
- **SOLID princibles**: 5 important princibles in Object Oriented Programming.
- **modular programming**: an approach to keep every feature separate from others to increase reusability of codes.
- **testing**: this app provides two type of tests for different layers of application: Unit tests and Widget tests.
- **mocktail**: a dart package to mock behavior of dependencies to do unit tests independent to them.
- **dotenv_flutter**: for keeping security keys more secure.
- **flutter_bloc**: a state management package for flutter, good one.
- **get_it**: a dart package for dependency injection in application.
- **encrypt_shared_preferences**: a package for encrypting data thar stored in local storage.
- **Github actions**: a powerful feature from github to automate CI/CD actions.

## CI/CD

**Continuous Integration (CI):** in summary, to run all tests automatically and verifying application has correct functionality every time we write a new code.
**Continuous Delivery (CI):** in summary, to compile and generate final exports automatically that users can install them on their devices.
Fortunately, using GitHub's excellent feature called GitHub Actions, both of these purposes have been implemented for this project. You can view the test results [here](https://github.com/amir14a/flutter_clean_architecture_task/actions/workflows/cd_actions.yml), and the installable outputs are available below.
